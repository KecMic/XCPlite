# XCPlite V6

Copyright 2024 Vector Informatik GmbH

Lightweight implementation of the ASAM XCP Protocol Layer V1.4.

New to XCP? Checkout Vectorï¿½s XCP Reference Book here: https://www.vector.com/int/en/know-how/protocols/xcp-measurement-and-calibration-protocol/xcp-book# or visit the Virtual VectorAcedemy for an E-Learning on XCP: https://elearning.vector.com/ 

Supports Linux 32/64 Bit and Windows 32/64 Bit. 

List of restrictions compared to Vectors free xcpBasic and commercial xcpProf in source file xcpLite.c. 

Supports XCP on Ethernet, TCP or UDP with jumbo frames. 
Thread safe, minimal thread lock and zero copy data acquisition. 
C and C++ support. 

Achieves up to 100 MByte/s throughput on a Raspberry Pi 4 (with jumbo frames enabled). 

No manual A2L creation (ASAP2 ECU description) required. 
An A2L with a reduced featureset is generated through code instrumentation during runtime and may be uploaded by XCP. 

## Included code examples (Build Targets):  

XCPlite:
  Getting started with a simple demo in C with minimum code and features. Shows the basics how to integrate XCP in existing applications. Compiles as C.
C_DEMO:
  Shows more sophisticated calibration, maps and curves, calibration page switching and EPK check. Compiles as C or C++.
CPP_Demo:
  XCP server as a C++ singleton. Demonstrates an approach how to calibrate and measure members of dynamic instances of classes. 


## Code instrumentation for measurement events:

Only simple code instrumentation needed for event triggering and data copy, event definition and data object definition. 

Example: 

### Definition:
```
  double channel1;
```

### Initialisation and A2L info generation:

```
  channel1 = 0;

  A2lCreateEvent("ECU"); // Create a new event with name "ECU""
  A2lSetEvent("ECU"); // Set event "ECU" to be associated to following measurement definitions
  A2lCreatePhysMeasurement(channel1, 2.0, 1.0, "Volt", "Demo floating point signal"); // Create a new measurement signal "channel1" with linear conversion rule (factor,offset) and unit "Volt"
```


### Measurement data acquisition event:

```
  channel1 += 0.6;
  XcpEvent(1); // Trigger event number 1, attach a timestamp and copy measurement data
```

## Configuration options:

All settings and parameters for the XCP protocol and transport layer are located in xcp_cfg.h and xcptl_cfg.h. 
Compile options for the different demo targets are located in main_cfg.h. 


## Notes:

- Specify the IP addr to bind (in main_cfg.h or on the command line (-bind)), if there are multiple Ethernet adapters. Otherwise the IP address of the Ethernet adapter found first, will be written to A2L file. 

- If A2L generation and upload is disabled, make sure CANape (or any other tool) is using an up to date A2L file with correct memory addresses and data types.  The A2L from ELF updater in CANape may be activated to achieve this. Be aware that XCP uses direct memory access, wrong addresses may lead to access fault or even worse to corrupt data. You may want to enable EPK check, to make sure the A2L description matches the ECU software.

- If A2L upload is enabled, you may need to set the IP address manually once. When connect is refused in CANape, press the flashing update icon in the statusbar.

- For the A2L Updater or CANapes automatic A2L address update, use Linker Map Type ELF extended for Linux a.out format or PDB for Microsoft .exe

- 64 bit builds needs all objects located within one 4 GByte data segment. Note that XCP addresses are 32 Bit plus 8 Bit extension. The conversion methods from pointer to A2l/XCP address and vice versa, are in xcpAppl.c and maybe changed for specific needs. xcpLite.c does not make assumptions on addresses. The only exception is during measurement, where XcpEvent creates pointers by adding the XCP/A2L address to ApplXcpGetBaseAddr(). To save space, the 32 Bit addresses, not 64 Bit pointers are stored in the DAQ lists. During measurement setup, ApplXcpGetPointer is called once to check for validity of the XCP/A2L address conversion. 
  
- Multicast time synchronisation (GET_DAQ_CLOCK_MULTICAST) is enabled in CANape by default. When measurement does not start, it is most probably a problem with multicast reception. Multicast provides no benefit with single clients or with PTP time synchronized clients and is therefore just unnessesary effort. Turn Multicast off in device/protocol/event/TIME_CORRELATION_GETDAQCLOCK by changing the option from "multicast" to "extended response"



## Version History

Version 6.x:
- Bugfixes, optimizations, refactorings and simplifications
- New targets XCPlite and XCPlite as a static library for Linux
- Support for C, C++ and Rust 
- Support for Vector Network Interfaces and integrated zero copy UDP stack removed, available on request at Vector
- Support for CANFD added, CAN not recomended because protocol layer not optimized for minumum message length 
- Improved support for PTP synchronized clock

Version 5.x:
- C and C++ Demo code seperated
- UDP or TCP support for sockets, UDP support for XL-API (Vector VN56xx Ethernet Interfaces)
- XL-API DLLs not included, download from Vector Website required
- Refactoring to reduce and clarify dependencies, platform.c and xcpAppl.c
- Improved cmake support
- XCP server implementation as a C++ class 
- Improved runtime type generation for A2L generator when compiled as C++
- Support for MacOS

Version 4.x:
- Refactoring to minimize dependencies
- All dependencies to UDP socket library in platform.h/.c
- Support for Vector XL-API removed


## Build

### Linux 

$ sudo apt-get install cmake g++ clang ninja-build

#### Build

```
$ cd XCPlite
$ nano C_Demo/CMakeLists.txt -> set(WINDOWS FALSE)
$ mkdir build_C_Demo

$ cd build_C_Demo
$ cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S ../C_Demo 
$ ninja

or

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S C_Demo -B build_C_Demo
$ cd build_C_Demo
$ make

```

### macOS 

$ brew install cmake gcc 

#### Build

Edit CMakeLists.txt: set(WINDOWS FALSE), set(MACOS TRUE)

```
$ cd XCPlite or cd CPP_Demo or cd C_DEMO
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build  
$ cs build
$ make
$ ./XCPlite.out

```


### Windows x86_64

Use the Visual Studio 19 projects included in the repo or build projects with CMake.

#### Build Visual Studio project and solution
```
Start cmake-gui
Choose your build options in the GUI
Start the generated VS solution
```

#### Build on Windows command line

```
For the CMake setup, prepare your command line environment.
Set compiler to Microsoft x64 cl.exe and make sure the system finds cmake.exe and ninja.exe.
You can also use the Windows clang compiler.
